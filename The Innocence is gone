Why do we live and die?
Why does love make us cry?
We wanted all the answers
We were younger then
We thought we could change the world
Hand in hand

I can remember when
We made sand turn to stone
And built our castles high
Time and tears have torn us down
I'm afraid to face the future
Hold me now
Where do we go from here?

After all the innocence is gone
(After all the tears)
It takes courage to believe
Love will last forever
Dreams die along the way
But together we are strong
I need you now to carry on

Why does time move so fast
We've got to make each moment last
We only get one lifetime
Everyday we're born again
We've got to learn to care again
Hold me now
I don't want to live without you

After all the innocence is gone...

You and I can fly again
Chasing down the rainbow's end
In the frozen hour of the darkest night
We can find the light

After all the innocence is gone...
